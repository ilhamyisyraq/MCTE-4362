# What's the different between the Edge AI Controller, Industrial PC, PLC, Microcontroller & Motor Controller  & etc (3-CONTROLLER)

# Edge AI Controller : 
Edge artificial intelligence (edge AI) is a paradigm for crafting AI workflows that span centralized data centers (the cloud) and devices outside the cloud that are closer to humans and physical things (the edge).

# Industrial PC : 
PC software are usually event-driven. An industrial PC is a computer with a form factor that falls between between a nettop and a server rack, and is designed for industrial use (the production of goods and services). Industrial computers have higher reliability and precision criteria than consumer computers, and therefore are often more expensive. They frequently use sophisticated instruction sets, such as x86, instead of simpler instruction sets, such as ARM.

# PLC : 
A PLC is capable of withstanding the strong amounts of both shock and vibration common to warehouse environments. A PLC usually follows a scan-based program execution. A ruggedized computer used for industrial automation is known as a Programmable Logic Controller, or PLC. These controllers can automate a single operation, a machine function, or an entire manufacturing line. The PLC collects data from connected sensors or input devices, processes it, and then activates outputs based on preset settings. A PLC can monitor and record run-time data such as machine productivity or operating temperature, start and stop processes automatically, create alarms if a machine fails, and more, depending on the inputs and outputs.

# Microcontroller : 
A microcontroller may work too as PLC, though it will require special mounting and connection considerations designed to hold up to this abuse. A microcontroller (MCU for microcontroller unit) is a miniature computer built on a single MOS integrated circuit (IC) chip. A microcontroller is a computer that contains one or more CPUs (processor cores), memory, and programmable input/output peripherals. A tiny amount of RAM, as well as programme memory in the form of ferroelectric RAM, NOR flash, or OTP ROM, is frequently provided on chip.

# Motor controller :
A motor controller is a device or collection of devices that can control the functioning of an electric motor in a predetermined manner. Â A motor controller can start and stop the motor manually or automatically, select forward or reverse rotation, select and regulate the speed, regulate or restrict the torque, and protect against overloads and electrical failures. To control the speed and direction of a motor, motor controllers may use electromechanical switching or power electronics devices.
