What's the different between the Edge AI Controller, Industrial PC, PLC, Microcontroller & Motor Controller  & etc (3-CONTROLLER)

Edge AI Controller: 
Edge artificial intelligence (edge AI) is a paradigm for crafting AI workflows that span centralized data centers (the cloud) and devices outside the cloud that are closer to humans and physical things (the edge).



Industrial PC: 
PC software are usually event-driven

PLC: 
A PLC is capable of withstanding the strong amounts of both shock and vibration common to warehouse environments. A PLC usually follows a scan-based program execution

Microcontroller and Motor controller: 
A microcontroller may work too as PLC, though it will require special mounting and connection considerations designed to hold up to this abuse.
